# --------------------- Exercise 3 ---------------------- #
print(bool(5 < 3))
# The output will be false as 5 is greater than 3
print(bool(3 == 3))
# The output will be true as 3 is an integer and are equal
print(bool(3 == "3"))
# There will be no output as the data type are difference hence cannot be changed
print(bool("3" > 3))
# There will be no output as the data type are difference hence cannot be changed
print("Hello" == "hello")
# The output will be false as despite the data type is the same but the value is not.
