    <p>I'm Tooshar Rohit Tarachand, on birthday is on <b>2nd of July</b>. I am a school leaver who is ready
        to embark on a new journey. Initially, I wanted to become a doctor in order to help
        my surroundings and help my community. Moreover, I wanted to revolutionise treatment.
        So, I was opined to opt another career which was more budget friendly.  Living in a
        computer era, learning how to code has become a life skill that every individual will need to now. One
        day while surfing on facebook, i saw a guy who is using coding and robotics to make new precise
        treatment for illness</p>
